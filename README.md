# AlphaCoderz

This is a minimal organization created by a CS student (0xMahabub) to do something as a team/community or buddies. We would like to do some open-source practice/real project and also can deliver some real-world solutions from it one day. :)

No matter how noobs or nerd you are, all of us are the same in one stage. And all of you are welcome :)
Just follow the given gudience and start exporing.

Be an alpha! Be a coder! :smile:
